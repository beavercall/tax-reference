### Additional Medicare Tax: Form 8959

Box 5 (”Medicare wages and tips”) of your W2 tells you the amount of your wages eligible for the additional medicare tax. Part 1 of this form computes how much Additional Medicare tax you owe on that money. 

Then, the amount of money already withheld from your paychecks for Medicare tax on box 6 (”Medicare tax withheld”) of your W2 is compared with your actual / “regular” Medicare tax withholding. 

On Schedule 2 you report the Additional Medicare Tax you owe, and on the Payments section of the 1040 you report how much was withheld from your paychecks already. 

### Net investment income tax: Form 8960

This form computes your total investment income (interest from checking/savings, dividends from your taxable brokerage account, capital gains/losses), then applies a 3.8% tax to it and adds that to how much tax you owe.
