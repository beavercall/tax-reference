Example Brokerage: [Vanguard](https://vanguard.com)

If you sell stock from the account, then you'll also get a 1099-B. 

The total amount of dividends you get show up as “ordinary dividends” on Schedule B and line 3b (”ordinary dividends” of Form 1040. The qualified dividends show up on line 3a of Form 1040 (”qualified dividends”). 

## Lines on the 1099-DIV
- Total ordinary dividends: the sum of all dividends received from stocks held in the portfolio of this account (you don’t “see” these payments during the year because they’re set to automatically get reinvested)
- Qualified dividends: dividends that get taxed at a lower rate. These dividends were paid once I’d held the underlying stocks for long enough to “qualify” them to get taxed at that lower rate.
- Section 199A dividends: dividends from REITs (the mutual funds REITs as a portion of their portfolio)
- Foreign tax paid: taxes paid on international investments; you’ll get a tax credit for this amount to pay less in US taxes
