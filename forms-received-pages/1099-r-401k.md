title: "401k Distributions from the Mega-Backdoor Roth 1099-R"
url: 1099-r-401k

Account: Company Retirement Account

Corresponds to the “Mega Backdoor” Roth 401(k) contribution and/or the rollover of employer matching contributions from pre-tax to Roth

- The SECURE 2.0 act allows employer matching contributions to go into Roth (instead of being limited to pre-tax). This is contingent on your employer also allowing this in their plan

### Relevant lines in the 1099-R

- Box 1: gross distribution is the total “distribution” into your Roth 401(k) account from the after-tax 401(k) [a rollover process known as the “mega backdoor”]
- Box 2a: taxable amount corresponds to the employer match amount originally contributed pre-tax and converted (by the employee) into Roth. This money is then taxable
- Box 5: “Employee contributions/ Designated Roth contributions or insurance premiums” is the amount of money you designated to contribute into your Roth 401(k)
- Distribution code G: indicates a direct rollover, which is not taxable. In this case it refers to the after-tax 401(k) getting rolled over into a Roth 401(k)

This shows up on line 5 of form 1040 (”pensions and annuities”). Line 5a is the gross distribution (the total) and line 5b on form 1040 is the taxable amount from box 2a of the 1099-R. The term “rollover” should be written next to the value

If you rollover your aftertax contributions to a Roth 401(k) ***and*** rollover the pre-tax employer match contribution, the net result is getting adding the value of the employer match contribution to your taxable income.
