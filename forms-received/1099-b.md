## For RSUs
This form shows the short-term capital gains tax paid on RSUs that were sold. Even if they’re set to automatically sell the same day that they vest, there is a differential between the price you received the share at (ie the price you paid for it) and the price you sold it at. The difference is either a capital gain or capital loss. It shows up on line 7 “capital gain (or loss)” of form 1040 and on Schedule D and on form 8949, in which you input (either individually for each sale or in aggregate) the proceeds (how much cash you got for selling the stock) and the cost basis (the price you paid), which are both listed on the 1099-B. The difference is your capital gain (or loss).
