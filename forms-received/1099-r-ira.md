Example: [Vanguard](https://vanguard.com)

Corresponds to the “Backdoor” Roth IRA contribution. 

Subject to the IRA contribution [limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits) ($6500 in 2023, $6000 in 2022)

The gross distribution and taxable amount listed are the amount of the “distribution” from the traditional IRA account the money was originally deposited into. In the case of a direct rollover from the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (ie a “Backdoor Roth” contribution), box 2b “taxable amount not determined” *should* be checked. This box is checked because the taxable amount depends on

- how much earnings you got on the original “principal” value contributed. Any earnings ***are*** taxable (but will be minimal if you convert to Roth immediately after the contribution)
- pro rata rule: how much pre-tax money is in your traditional IRA. If $0 (besides the contribution that gets converted to Roth), then you don’t pay any extra taxes. If greater than $0, the backdoor Roth contribution gets taxed on a prorated basis: the proportion of pretax money in your traditional IRA is the proportion of the conversion (backdoor Roth contribution) that’s taxable

The value of the distribution shows up as line 4a (IRA distributions) on form 1040, while the “backdoor Roth” should make the taxable amount (line 4b on form 1040) $0 or close to it (slightly higher if there were earnings in between contributing to the traditional IRA and converting to the Roth IRA). 

- This calculation is done out on Form 8606, using worksheet 1-1 in publication 590 B
