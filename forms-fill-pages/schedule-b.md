Interest from checking/savings accounts and dividends from your taxable brokerage account. This information gets put onto lines 2 (interest) and 3 (dividends) of form 1040, and specifies how much of that income is taxable. 

- All interest from a checking/savings account is taxable
- Dividends from a brokerage are taxable, but qualified dividends are taxed at a lower rate
